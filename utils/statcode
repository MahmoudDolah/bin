# This data was manually put together by refering to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
# The JSON data minified using 'jq -c . FILE'. In order to to make it easier to read/edit the JSON data,
# just added the following code on the line after 'json_data' and execute this script.
#   jq <<< "$json_data" && exit

{"100":{"status_name":"Continue","class":"Information response","description":"This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue the request, or ignore the response if the request is already finished."},"101":{"status_name":"Switching Protocol","class":"Information response","description":"This code is sent in response to an \"Upgrade\" request header from the client, and indicates the protocol the server is switching to."},"102":{"status_name":"Processing","class":"Information response","description":"This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet."},"103":{"status_name":"Early Hints","class":"Information response","description":"This status code is primarily intended to be used with the \"Link\" header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response"},"200":{"status_name":"OK","class":"Successful response","description":"The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:\n  - GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.\n  - HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.\n  - PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.\n  - TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.\n"},"201":{"status_name":"Created","class":"Successful response","description":"The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests."},"202":{"status_name":"Accepted","class":"Successful response","description":"The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing."},"203":{"status_name":"Non-Authoritative Information","class":"Successful response","description":"This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the \"200 OK\" response is preferred to this status"},"204":{"status_name":"No Content","class":"Successful response","description":"There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones."},"205":{"status_name":"Reset Content","class":"Successful response","description":"Tells the user-agent to reset the document which sent this request."},"206":{"status_name":"Partial Content","class":"Successful response","description":"This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource."},"207":{"status_name":"Multi-Status","class":"Successful response","description":"Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate."},"208":{"status_name":"Already Reported","class":"Successful response","description":"Used inside a <dav:propstat> response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection."},"209":{"status_name":"IM Used","class":"Successful response","description":"The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance."},"300":{"status_name":"Mutliple Choice","class":"Redirection message","description":"The request has more than one possible response. The user-agent or user should choose one of them. (There is no standardized way of choosing one of the responses, but HTML links to the possibilities are recommended so the user can pick.)"},"301":{"status_name":"Removed Permanently","class":"Redirection message","description":"The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response."},"302":{"status_name":"Found","class":"Redirection message","description":"This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. Further changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests."},"303":{"status_name":"See Other","class":"Redirection message","description":"The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request."},"304":{"status_name":"Not Modified","class":"Redirection message","description":"This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response."},"305":{"status_name":"Use proxy","class":"Redirection message","description":"Defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band configuration of a proxy."},"307":{"status_name":"Temporary Redirect","class":"Redirect message","description":"The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with same method that was used in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the 302 Found HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the second request."},"308":{"status_name":"Permanent Redirect","class":"Redirect message","description":"This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the Location: HTTP Response header. This has the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the second request."},"400":{"status_name":"Bad Request","class":"Client error response","description":"The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax."},"401":{"status_name":"Unauthorized","class":"Client error response","description":"Although the HTTP standard specifies \"unauthorized\", semantically this response means \"unauthenticated\". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response."},"402":{"status_name":"Payment Required","class":"Client error response","description":"This response code is reserved for future use. The initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this status code is used very rarely and no standard convention exists."},"403":{"status_name":"Forbidden","class":"Client error response","description":"The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server."},"404":{"status_name":"Not Found","class":"Client error response","description":"The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurrence on the web."},"405":{"status_name":"Method Not Allowed","class":"Client error response","description":"The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource. The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this error code."},"406":{"status_name":"Not Acceptable","class":"Client error response","description":"This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent."},"407":{"status_name":"Proxy Authentication Required","class":"Client error response","description":"This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy."},"408":{"status_name":"Request Timeout","class":"Client error response","description":"This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message."},"409":{"status_name":"Conflict","class":"Client error response","description":"This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server."},"410":{"status_name":"Gone","class":"Client error response","description":"This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for \"limited-time, promotional services\". APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code."},"411":{"status_name":"Length Required","class":"Client error response","description":"Server rejected the request because the Content-Length header field is not defined and the server requires it."},"412":{"status_name":"Precondition Failed","class":"Client error response","description":"The client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet."},"413":{"status_name":"Payload Too Large","class":"Client error response","description":"Request entity is larger than limits defined by server; the server might close the connection or return an Retry-After header field."},"414":{"status_name":"URI Too Long","class":"The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.","description":"The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request."},"415":{"status_name":"Unsupported Media Type","class":"Client error response","description":"The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request."},"416":{"status_name":"Range Not Satisfiable","class":"Client error response","description":"The range specified by the Range header field in the request can't be fulfilled; it's possible that the range is outside the size of the target URI's data."},"417":{"status_name":"Expectation Failed","class":"Client error response","description":"This response code means the expectation indicated by the Expect request header field can't be met by the server."},"418":{"status_name":"I'm a teapot","class":"Client error response","description":"The server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014."},"421":{"status_name":"Misdirected Request","class":"Client error response","description":"The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI."},"422":{"status_name":"Unprocessable Entity","class":"Client error response","description":"The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors."},"423":{"status_name":"Locked","class":"Client error response","description":"The resource that is being accessed is locked."},"424":{"status_name":"Failed Dependency","class":"Client error response","description":"The request failed due to failure of a previous request."},"425":{"status_name":"Too Early","class":"Client error response","description":"Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed."},"426":{"status_name":"Upgrade Required","class":"Client error response","description":"The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol. The server sends an Upgrade header in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s)."},"428":{"status_name":"Precondition Required","class":"Client error response","description":"The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict."},"429":{"status_name":"Too Many Requests","class":"Client error response","description":"The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\")."},"431":{"status_name":"Request Header Fields Too Large","class":"Client error response","description":"The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request may be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields."},"451":{"status_name":"Unavailable For Legal Reasons","class":"Client error response","description":"The user-agent requested a resource that cannot legally be provided, such as a web page censored by a government."},"500":{"status_name":"Internal Server Error","class":"Server error response","description":"The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle."},"501":{"status_name":"Not Implemented","class":"Server error response","description":"The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that must not return this code) are GET and HEAD."},"502":{"status_name":"Bad Gateway","class":"Server error response","description":"This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response."},"503":{"status_name":"Service Unavailable","class":"Server error response","description":"The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent. This responses should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After: HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time before the recovery of the service. The webmaster must also take care about the caching-related headers that are sent along with this response, as these temporary condition responses should usually not be cached."},"504":{"status_name":"Gateway Timeout","class":"Server error response","description":"This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time."},"505":{"status_name":"HTTP Version Not Supported","class":"Server error response","description":"The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server."},"506":{"status_name":"Variant Also Negotiates","class":"Server error response","description":"The server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process."},"507":{"status_name":"Insufficient Storage","class":"Server error response","description":"The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request."},"508":{"status_name":"Loop Detected","class":"Server error response","description":"The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request."},"510":{"status_name":"Server error response","class":"Server error response","description":"Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it."},"511":{"status_name":"Network Authentication Required","class":"Server error response","description":"The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access."}}
