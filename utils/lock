# Since I use betterlockscreen as my greeter, instead of something like
# GDM, I need to make sure, that there is an image it can use for the
# lockscreen or else betterlockscreen will crash. This creates a security hole
# in my system. Since I have autologin, betterlockscreen is my only security
# I have.

# Pause mpd and send the pause key to all mpv videos
# before locking the screen
mpc pause > /dev/null 2>&1
pauseallmpv > /dev/null 2>&1
